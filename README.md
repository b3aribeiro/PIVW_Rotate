# Perceptions in Virtual Worlds : Project Rotate

This game was created by @b3aribeiro and @fourtap4444 as part of research and experimentation on perception within virtual worlds.

The goal was to investigate if players can understand their relationship with the virtual environment by adding different audio and visual cues. 

The project was developed in Unity.
Player's actions were tracked and data were analysed after each gameplay.
