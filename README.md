# Perceptions in Virtual Worlds : Project Rotate

This game was created by @b3aribeiro and @fourtap4444, graduate students from Parsons, School of Design, as part of their Perception in Virtual Worlds class. The goal here was to investigate if players can understand their relationship with the virtual environemnt though the addition of different audio and visual cues.
